canvas-flowchart
================

The flowchart.js file adds methods to the CanvasRenderingContext2D object for drawing shapes common to simple flowcharts.

This is not a stand-alone framework - you need to know how to draw using canvas first.

For an example of how it is used, see the factorial-flowchart.html file.

If you want to use this in slightly older browsers, I have used the [excanvas](https://github.com/yinso/excanvas/blob/master/excanvas.js) library. successfully.

coodinates.js
-------------

This is a small JavaScript library that helps to find the x and y coordinates in a canvas element for building your flowcharts.
